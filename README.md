# RustDocsHandsOn

<<<<<<< HEAD
Welcome to the RustDocsHandsOn repository! This repository is dedicated to helping new learners explore the Rust programming language and dive into various Rust libraries. It serves as a platform for sharing my learning journey from the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org) and my hands-on experience with Rust programming.

## About

This repository contains a collection of code examples, projects, and notes that I've created while studying Rust using the official Rust documentation. The primary focus is to empower newcomers by demonstrating Rust's syntax, concepts, and real-world applications through practical examples and projects.

## Contents

- [Code Examples](./code-examples): Dive into a variety of standalone code snippets and examples showcasing different Rust concepts and techniques. Each example is documented and categorized for easy reference.

- [Projects](./projects): Explore more substantial Rust projects that I've developed. Each project comes with detailed explanations, allowing you to see how to apply Rust's features to solve real problems.

- [Notes](./notes): Access my personal notes on Rust programming. These notes encompass a broad range of topics, from fundamental language constructs to more advanced library usage.



## Contributing
